# TVium
TVium is to Connected TVs what Chromium is to Connected PCs, the native shared toolkit for the right product of TV and the Internet
* Unified by **channels**, as Connected PCs are unified by **sites** and Connected Mobile Phones are unified by **apps**
* Building on **HbbTV**, the best product of Web and Broadcast base standards
* Uncompromising on **personal data**, compliant by design with GDPR and local rules like CNIL's 
* Adjusting broadly by **broadcast native** pure players  
* Developing a **standardized** layer for common features
* Differentiable by each customizing its **TVia** by configuration and integration
* Siding on a **client** yet defining a common API to be served by each broadcaster
* Biasing more towards **frequency** vs **depth** when releasing
* Open to any **contribution** 
* Aiming for the easiest **support** by the main TV OEMs and operators and the easiest **service** by broadcasters

## TVium is broadcast driven connected TVs, neither like connected PCs nor like connected mobiles

## TVium is open source toolkit, neither like a pure spec nor like a complete product

| Product | For device OEMs | For channels broadcasters | For service providers | 
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|
| Spec    | Many units to test | Hard on (many) differences    | one shot custom dev |
| Complete | One unit to integrate | Just to use but risk of lockin | binary cost intensive competitions |
| TVium | One unit to support | Just to configure without lockin | continuous value added services |
