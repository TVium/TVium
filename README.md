# TVium
TVium is to Connected TVs what Chromium is to Connected PCs
* Channels unified, as Connected PCs are unified by Sites and Connected Mobile Phones are unified by Apps
* Building on HbbTV, the best product of Web and Broadcast standards 
* Uncompromising on personal data, compliant by design with GDPR and local rules like CNIL's 
* Adjusting broadly by broadcast native pure players  
* Developing a shared layer for common features
* Differentiable by each customizing its TVia by configuration and integration
* Cient-side yet defining a common API to be served by each broadcaster
* Frequently releasing via Scrum
* Open to any contribution 
* Aiming for the easiest support by the main TV OEMs and operators
