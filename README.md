# TVium
TVium is to Connected TVs what Chromium is to Connected PCs
* Unified by _channels_, as Connected PCs are unified by _sites_ and Connected Mobile Phones are unified by _apps_
* Building on _HbbTV_, the best product of Web and Broadcast base standards
* Uncompromising on _personal data_, compliant by design with GDPR and local rules like CNIL's 
* Adjusting broadly by _broadcast_ native pure players  
* Developing a _shared_ layer for common features
* Differentiable by each customizing its _TVia_ by configuration and integration
* Siding on a _cient_ yet defining a common API to be served by each broadcaster
* Biasing more towards _frequency_ than _gross_ when releasing
* Open to any _contribution_ 
* Aiming for the easiest _support_ by the main TV OEMs and operators and the easiest _service_ by broadcasters
